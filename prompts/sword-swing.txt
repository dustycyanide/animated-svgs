Create a high-quality animated SVG of a video game character swinging a sword.

Art direction:
- Stylized 2D action-game look, readable silhouette, clean linework.
- Full-body character centered on canvas.
- Sword slash arc should feel powerful and fluid.

Animation requirements:
- Seamless loop around 2.0 to 3.0 seconds.
- Anticipation: slight wind-up before the strike.
- Action: fast sword swing with a bright slash trail.
- Recovery: return to idle-ready stance.
- Add subtle secondary motion (cape/hair/cloth) synced to movement.

Technical constraints:
- Use only SVG/SMIL or CSS animation (no JavaScript).
- Keep structure organized with grouped layers.
- Prefer performance-friendly shapes and transforms.
